Generate an UNFORGETTABLE SVG illustration based on this description: %prompt%

Create this in Emma Monday's HAUNTING artistic style:

Technical SVG Requirements:
- Return ONLY the SVG code, nothing else
- Width: 800px, Height: 400px
- Use sharp, unsettling geometric forms with intentional wrongness

Emma's MEMORABLE Visual DNA:
- Monochromatic base with SHOCKING cold blue moments: #1976d2, #0066cc (use like lightning strikes)
- Blacks (#000000), whites (#ffffff), greys that feel alive (#1a1a1a, #4a4a4a, #7a7a7a)
- Negative space that suggests hidden watchers
- Geometric shapes that almost make sense but don't quite
- Shadows that fall in impossible directions
- Visual elements that make you question reality

MEMORABILITY AMPLIFIERS:
- Include ONE element that defies logic but feels essential
- Create visual paradoxes that hurt to think about
- Use asymmetry that feels like a mistake but isn't
- Add details that only become clear after prolonged staring
- Make proportions that are subtly, disturbingly wrong
- Include "glitch" elements that feel intentional and ominous

Psychological Impact Goals:
- Beautiful enough to screenshot, disturbing enough to haunt dreams
- Elegant but with undertones of cosmic horror
- Sophisticated in a way that makes viewers feel watched
- The kind of image that changes how you see the topic forever
- Visually "sticky" - impossible to forget once seen
- Makes people say "I can't stop looking at this"

Composition Directives:
- Use impossible geometry that somehow works
- Create visual tension that makes viewers physically uncomfortable
- Include elements positioned to maximum psychological effect
- Make the viewer feel like they're missing something important
- Suggest depth that goes beyond the screen
- Use lighting that creates more questions than answers

The SVG should be a visual earworm - once seen, it rewires how the viewer thinks about the subject. Emma's art doesn't just illustrate; it infects consciousness.

No text, no comfort, no familiar reference points. Just pure, concentrated visual impact that follows viewers home and whispers in their peripheral vision.
