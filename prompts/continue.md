Continue rewriting the Wikipedia article section. Keep ALL facts accurate, maintain the FULL structure with headings. Do NOT shorten or summarize - rewrite everything in detail and extend. IMPORTANT: Preserve ONLY internal Wikipedia links (links to other Wikipedia articles) in Markdown format [text](/article_name). Do NOT add external links or change internal links to external. Keep all internal links exactly as they appear in the original. Return Markdown format.
